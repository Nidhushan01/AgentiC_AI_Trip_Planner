Agentic AI Trip Navigator is an intelligent travel planning system built using CrewAI and LangChain frameworks. Designed as an agentic AI application, it coordinates the efforts of three specialized agents — guide_expert, location_expert, and planner_expert — to collaboratively generate personalized travel itineraries.

By leveraging real-time data through the DuckDuckGoSearchResults web search tool, the system dynamically gathers location-specific insights, tourist recommendations, and event information. Users simply provide their destination city and travel dates, and the AI agents autonomously collaborate to deliver:

A detailed trip plan

A comprehensive city report

A contextual guide report

A structured travel itinerary
